# Pokemon Lab

1.	Create a class called ```Pokemon``` with double values for the Pokemon’s ```weight``` and ```catchRate```. Also, add integers to represent the Pokemon’s ```level``` and ```attackPower```.
2.	Add a constant ```double MAX_CATCH_RATE``` set to 0.25.
3.	Add a constructor that sets the weight and level length through two parameters.  Also, in this constructor, set the ```catchRate``` to a random number between 0 and ```MAX_CATCH_RATE``` (inclusive) and set the ```attackPower``` to a random integer between 60 and 70 (inclusive).
4.	Add accessor methods ```getWeight```, ```getLevel```, ```getCatchRate``` and ```getAttackPower```.
5.	Add a ```gainWeight``` method that causes a Pokemon to get 5% heavier.  
6.	Add a ```workout``` method that causes a Pokemon to lose 5% of its weight.  
7.	Add a ```levelUp``` method that raises the Pokemon’s level by one and increases its attackPower by 5%.  
8.	Add a ```cry``` method that returns the string “Pokemon!”.  
9.	Add a ```toString``` method that is formatted exactly as follow (in this example, for a level 2 Pokemon that weighs 5.0): 
The Pokemon is level 2 and weighs 5.0.
10.	Add method 

        boolean equals(Object obj) 
        
    to show that this Pokemon and obj are equal if they have the same level.
